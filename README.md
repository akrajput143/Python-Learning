# Why learn Python?

Python is a versatile and popular programming language. It's great as a first language because it is concise and easy to read, and it is also a good language to have in any programmer's 
stack as it can be used for everything from web development to software development and scientific applications. 

# Prerequisites

1. Installing Python
.. Installing Python is generally easy, and most of the time many Linux and UNIX distributions include a recent Python. 
.. If you do need to install Python and aren't confident about the task you can find a few notes on the [Windows-link](../master/windows-installation.md). 

2. Open a GIT account - Link to GIT repo [site](https://github.com/) ** Optional
